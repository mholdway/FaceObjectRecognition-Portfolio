This file identifies and explains the variables in the experiment. The variables and explanations are listed below.

1. Participant: There were 35 participants in our experiment. Each participant was assigned a different number from 1 to 35 in order to organize the data and prepare it for data analysis.
  
2. Age: There were five age ranges to which participants indicated they belonged: 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64. We did not explore age differences in this study, but suggest that any differences in age groups could be explored in the future.
  
3. Gender: Participants indicated whether they were male or female. We did not analyze gender differences in our study, but suggest that gender could be explored in future studies.

Scores: The total number of correct responses for each of the two conditions (Face and Object) are listed under the heading "Scores" for each participant. All "Face" correct responses are listed first, followed by all "Object" correct responses. A description of what constituted a correct answer is given under the variable Condition.

Condition: There were two conditions in this experiment, Face and Object. They are listed below along with a description of what constituted a correct response.

  * Face: We presented participants with an array of six faces and asked them to indicate whether a probe face was an exact match to a previously seen face in the array or not. Correct answers were either "Y" for items that were an exact match, or "N" for items that were only similar but were not an exact match. Correct answers were tallied and the totals appear under the heading "Scores" and next to the Condition "Face" in the RecognitionData.csv file. Face images consisted of one female and one male photo for five age categories (infant, child, teen, young adult, adult, and older adult) in five race categories (Caucasian, African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern).
  
  * Object: We presented participants with an array of six detailed non-living objects and asked them to indicate whether a probe detailed non-living object was an exact match to a previously seen detailed non-living object in the array or not. Correct answers were either "Y" for items that were an exact match, or "N" for items that were only similar but were not an exact match. Correct answers were tallied and the totals appear under the heading "Scores" and next to the Condition "Object" in the RecognitionData.csv file. Objects were from the categories of machinery, grandfather clocks, tools, shoes, monuments, and office equipment.
